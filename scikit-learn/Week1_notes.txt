Unsupervised learning: learn the structure of unlabeled data: clustering or
detecting outliers

Supervised learning: mapping input data to labeled data, either classification or regression

Scikit-learn has a function to split the training and test set

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split[X, y, random_state=0]
random_state provides a seed value for the random number generator

Looking at data before doing anything is important: 
- some cleaning and preprocessing may be required
- missing or noisy data/inconsistencies
- can the problem be solved without machine learning?

It's good to have an idea of how well clustered the data are in feature space

kNN or k-nearest neighbours algorithm is an instance space learning method
